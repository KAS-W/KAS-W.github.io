# Probabilities and Statistics #

Quick review of probs & stats

## Basic Statistics
- Skewness: $\mathbb{S}[X]=\frac{1}{\sigma^3}\mathbb{E}[(X-\mu)^3]$
    - a measure of the asymmetry of the distribution
    - skew of a normal distribution is always 0
    - skew = 0 does not mean the variable must be normally distributed
    - positive skew: right tail is longer than the left
    - negative skew: left tail is longer than the right
- Kurtosis: $\mathbb{K}[X]=\frac{1}{\sigma^4}\mathbb{E}[(X-\mu)^4]$
    - a measure of the heavy-tailedness of the distribution
    - kurt of a normal distribition is always 3
    - kurt = 3 does not mean the variable must be normally distributed
    - kurt > 3: the tails are heavier (fatter) than those normal distribution, outcomes far from the mean are *more likely from the normal*.
    - kurt < 3: the tails are thinner than those normal distribution, outcomes far from the mean are *less likely from the normal*.
