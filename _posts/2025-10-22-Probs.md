# Probabilities and Statistics #

Quick review of probs & stats

## Basic Statistics
- Skewness: $$\mathbb{S}[X]=\frac{1}{\sigma^3}\mathbb{E}[(X-\mu)^3]$$
    - a measure of the asymmetry of the distribution
    - skew of a normal distribution is always 0
    - skew = 0 does not mean the variable must be normally distributed
    - positive skew: right tail is longer than the left
    - negative skew: left tail is longer than the right
- Kurtosis: $$\mathbb{K}[X]=\frac{1}{\sigma^4}\mathbb{E}[(X-\mu)^4]$$
    - a measure of the heavy-tailedness of the distribution
    - kurt of a normal distribition is always 3
    - kurt = 3 does not mean the variable must be normally distributed
    - kurt > 3: the tails are heavier (fatter) than those normal distribution, outcomes far from the mean are *more likely from the normal*.
    - kurt < 3: the tails are thinner than those normal distribution, outcomes far from the mean are *less likely from the normal*.

## Law of Large Number:
Some i.i.d. with common mean $$\mu$$ $$X_1, \dots, X_n$$: $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^\infty X_k=\mu$$

## Central Limit Theorem:
For i.i.d. $$X_1, \dots, X_n$$ each with expected value $$\mu$$ and variance $$\sigma^2 < \infty$$ as $$n \rightarrow \infty$$: $$\sqrt{n}(\overline{X}-\mu) \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$$
