# FMA4200 Final Project: Time Series Modeling for Financial Data #

[Time-Series Modeling on Monthly Returns and Trading Strategies with 6 Portfolios](https://KAS-W.github.io/assets/pdf/FMA4200_Final_Project.pdf)

The project **modeled data distribution** and **explored arbitrage strategies** by implementing fundamental time-series analysis.

The paper also introduced optimal mean-variance method to lower the volatility of each portfolio, and made comparison between the classical algorithm and its variant:
- Least mean-variance algorithm
- Black-Litterman algorithm

Results:
- Prior knowledge (investors' options, market equilibrium, etc.) brings in extra information (alpha enhancement)
- Lower risk penalty coefficient can improve annualized returns
