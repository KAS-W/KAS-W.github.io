# Post-Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD) #
[Event-driven Alpha](https://github.com/KAS-W/event_driven_alpha)

The project researched on the effects of announcement on abnormal returns to the excess returns of stocks in the Chinese A-share market.

## Findings ##
The project discovered that:
- The ten groups exhibit a pronounced and systematic separation in their Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CARs) throughout the entire event window.
- Price adjustment is not instantaneous after the announcement (inefficiency did exist).
- The significant divergence in CARs before the event date indicates that the market was already pricing in the upcoming positive or negative information.

## Simple Alpha Design ##
Considering only the two groups with the highest and lowest SUE, we initiate a long/short strategy maintained for 120 days after the announcement:

Only consider the test for HS300 coverage:

## Takeaways ##
The source of returns for the PEAD effect is primarily style rotation/shift, such as transitioning from shorting small-cap, poor-performing stocks to going long on high-quality, large-cap stocks. The risk is mainly contributed by short-selling restrictions and a subsequent style reversal. Therefore, this project also demonstrates that the profit and loss sources of this announcement-based, event-driven alpha are fundamentally the same.
